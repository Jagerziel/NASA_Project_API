characteristics of the NASA astronaut population (age, education/discipline).  Subject cognitive performance was assessed before and after executing eighteen sessions of remote cognitive training using six exercises within an adaptive app-based COTS software package (BrainHQ, Posit Science) on study-provided tablets.  Pre- and post-training cognitive performance was measured using internal BrainHQ assessments as well as Cognition Test Battery (CTB), an independent software test developed specifically for NASA and used currently in research studies on astronauts.  BrainHQ exercises were posited to map well or partially to several CTB sub-tests.  Subjects provided feedback on their study experience formally via survey at the conclusion of testing and informally throughout the study if

overcome. The JSC-directed solicitations program enables the center to invest strategically in high priority areas needed to accomplish future missions, as articulated in the NASA Technology Roadmaps and the Space Technology Investment Plan (STIP). It offers the center the ability to address technology gaps that are beyond the requirements of near-term programs to fund.&nbsp; The program also provides a platform to continue to grow and maintain critical skills and innovations needed to ensure future mission success.&nbsp; These solicitations encourage use of collaborations to ensure maximum benefit to both the space program and the nation.&nbsp; As such, external partnerships are highly encouraged not only as a funding leverage but to bring innovative ideas and approaches into human exploration programs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Selection Process</em></p><p>Typically, JSC solicitations are developed by the JSC CTO and the JSC Technology Working Group (JTWG). Competitive calls are coordinated with JSC Senior Staff and communicated to the JSC workforce via internal email distribution to an R&amp;D community list and through postings on the internal center website and through JSC Today notices.<br /><br />The JTWG solicits, evaluates and prioritizes all JSC solicitation responses in a two-stage process. The JTWG members review project proposals and work together to down-select to the finalists. The Principal Investigators (PIs) make presentations to the JTWG to provide more in-depth project details. This allows the members to have multiple sets of data to select the most innovative finalists to support for the year.&nbsp; Selection criteria and funding vary based on the focus of the solicitation; but of primary interest are:</p><ul><li>Human Space Flight Architecture Team (HAT) prioritized technology needs</li><li>Priority JSC technology core competencies</li><li>High potential areas for technology commercialization</li><li>High potential areas for technology partnerships</li></ul><p><em>Project Accomplishments</em></p><p>Through the result of research and development, JSC&rsquo;s IR&amp;D project PIs are making essential progress in the advancement of technology needed to enable NASA&rsquo;s mission of space exploration. Additionally, many of the technologies developed to meet the challenges of space exploration have great commercialization potential. Each year, many of JSC&rsquo;s IR&amp;D projects file New Technology Reports (NTRs) through the JSC Tech Transfer Office. Several of these reports have received New Technology Evaluation Patent ratings to pursue patents, while additional ones have been scheduled for success story articles to be written and published.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JSC projects active in FY12 and beyond have been included in TechPort. Through the TechPort tool information on the projects is provided and will be updated by PIs as developments and updates become available.

It is an evolution of the JWST micro-shutter technology and is transitioning from APRA to SAT program development for TRL maturation to level 5 in support of four science instruments in three Decadal Survey mission concept studies, 1 Explorer mission concept, and a sounding rocket program. The APRA-funded development of the NGMSA focused exclusively on eliminating the magnetic actuation and was successful on 128 x 64 pixel format pilot arrays. However, it utilized the JWST-era MEMS manufacturing process for which our ability to achieve recurrent manufacturability is low. We have severe process yield problems to resolve.&nbsp; We have designed a MEMS architecture change that is simpler to fabricate than the JWST-era process that we are currently struggling with and intended to use for the proposed SAT program. The technical objective of this IRAD project is to prototype this new MEMS architecture in order to achieve recurrent manufacturability. This IRAD work is critical to the success of the subsequent SAT effort to bring large (840 x 420 pixel) format arrays to TRL-5 for five science instrument applications that have baselined it. We believe that our ability to successfully perform the SAT-proposed work will depend critically on prototyping the process change described below on a small 128 x 64 pixel pilot arrays using IRAD resources. This IRAD request is not duplicative of any other proposal. It reflects breakthrough thinking that was not appreciated when the SAT proposal was written.</p>","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1547,"code":"OUTSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Outside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"supportedMission":{"lkuCodeId":1540,"code":"PLANNED_MISSION","description":"Planned Mission (Pull)","lkuCodeTypeId":527,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"SUPPORTED_MISSION_TYPE","description":"Supported Mission Type"}},"startYear":2018,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2019,"endMonth":9,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":321691,"displayOrder":1,"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Greenhouse","fullName":"Matthew A Greenhouse","fullNameInverted":"Greenhouse, Matthew A","middleInitial":"A","primaryEmail":"matt.greenhouse@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":373483,"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Hughes","fullName":"Peter M Hughes","fullNameInverted":"Hughes, Peter M","middleInitial":"M","primaryEmail":"peter.m.hughes@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"projectManagers":[{"contactId":265579,"displayOrder":1,"firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Jahoda","fullName":"Keith M Jahoda","fullNameInverted":"Jahoda, Keith M","middleInitial":"M","primaryEmail":"keith.m.jahoda@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":140744,"displayOrder":2,"firstName":"Emily","lastName":"Wilson","fullName":"Emily Wilson","fullNameInverted":"Wilson, Emily","publicEmail":false,"nacontact":false}],"website":"https://www.facebook.com/NASA.GSFC","libraryItems":[{"caption":"New micro-shutter array architecture enables the shutter array (upper left) and light shields (shown at lower right integrated with the electrical fan-out substrate).

This has the potential to recover 575 pounds of water per year from brine. This represents roughly $10M per year in savings on water resupply costs. While the primary function of the CoBRA is to recover water from concentrated wastewater brines generated by a primary processor, the CoBRA may be able to function as a primary processor itself. Current state-of-the-art primary processors rely on rotating drums, pitot pumps, lobe compressors, and other sensitive machinery for operation. This equipment has a history of becoming fouled due to solids precipitation. In the case of a failure of the primary processor, the CoBRA could serve as a backup, providing dissimilar redundancy to ensure crew survival. Upon successful demonstration of a proof-of-concept evaporator, Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) will provide funding for further development. This will lead to infusion of CoBRA technology into an integrated closed-loop life support system architecture. The CoBRA will then be poised to play a key role in a future ground-based integrated life support systems test, and an eventual ISS detailed test objective (DTO). After a successful DTO, CoBRA could be integrated into the International Space Station (ISS) life support system, with the potential to recover 575 pounds of water per year from brine. This represents roughly $10M per year in savings on water resupply costs. Leveraging the extensive technology maturation and testing accomplished through a DTO, the CoBRA will then be ready for use by future deep-space exploration programs.

While it will be necessary to build or modify a system for testing the CoBRA concept, the emphasis of this project will be on developing the evaporator itself. This project will utilize a \"test early, test often\" approach, building at least one trial evaporator to guide the design of the final product.</p>","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1545,"code":"THE_SUN","description":"The Sun","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2014,"startMonth":11,"endYear":2015,"endMonth":10,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":450794,"firstName":"Stuart","lastName":"Pensinger","fullName":"Stuart J Pensinger","fullNameInverted":"Pensinger, Stuart J","middleInitial":"J","primaryEmail":"stuart.j.pensinger@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":335305,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lapointe","fullName":"Michael R Lapointe","fullNameInverted":"Lapointe, Michael R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"michael.r.lapointe@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":392233,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Howard","fullName":"Richard W Howard","fullNameInverted":"Howard, Richard W","middleInitial":"W","primaryEmail":"richard.w.howard@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62108,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Westhelle","fullName":"Carlos H Westhelle","fullNameInverted":"Westhelle, Carlos H","middleInitial":"H","primaryEmail":"carlos.h.westhelle@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

technologies to more effectively reject heat on a flight. Technologies are needed to make these methods more reliable and standardized and increase the capability for effective ground testing. This area includes technologies that manage system heat primarily through the use of the thermal and/or optical properties of a given material.

State-of-the-Art: Dual loop TCS with oversized radiators and an external flow loop with a toxic low freezing point fluid that connects to a non-toxic inner cabin loop via an interface heat exchanger. This TCS architecture is employed in Orion and can achieve a 3:1 turndown ratio. Design concepts for cis-lunar habitats have employed a dual-loop architecture with a regenerative heat exchanger to achieve a 8:1 turndown ratio. ","description":"Innovative aspect: The morphing radiator uses SMAs to passively change its heat rejection area (opening/closing its cylindrical panel). The concept can provide high turndown: >12:1 with a single loop active TCS. During FY16 a composite radiator panel was developed, and demonstrated actuating with SMAs in ambient and thermal vacuum environments.FY17 objective: Develop an entire practical radiator design and produce a subscale segment of a multi-panel radiator with the following approach: 1) Create custom SMAs to open/close the radiator at the hot/cold cases expected by a single loop active TCS for a manned spacecraft (cis-lunar/mars missions). 2) Integrate the SMAs into the radiator panel design. 3) Develop a processing method to bond SMAs to the radiator face sheet. 4) Develop a robust method to bond the radiator panel to its flow tube. 5) Build upon existing analytical tools to expedite radiator design. Next steps after FY17 work: 1)System-level ground test on the produced radiator. 2)Investigate methods to provide a low absorptivity/high emissivity coating of the radiator panel. 3)ISS express pallet flight demonstration. Comparison to other variable heat rejection approaches: As opposed to stagnating, freezable, and digital radiators, this concept does not require emptying/refilling of passages (which risks freezing upon refilling), or modification of the radiator fluid's state (recovering from freezing/stagnating can be very slow and difficult to predict). JAxA/ISAS developed and thermal vacuum tested a passive SMA actuated flat radiator panel for a 100W class satellite [Nagano and Nagasaka 2006].","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1543,"code":"EARTH","description":"Earth","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1544,"code":"THE_MOON","description":"The Moon","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1518,"code":"MARS","description":"Mars","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2016,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2017,"endMonth":7,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":294703,"firstName":"Lisa","lastName":"Erickson","fullName":"Lisa Erickson","fullNameInverted":"Erickson, Lisa","primaryEmail":"lisa.erickson@ngc.com","publicEmail":false,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":335305,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lapointe","fullName":"Michael R Lapointe","fullNameInverted":"Lapointe, Michael R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"michael.r.lapointe@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":392233,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Howard","fullName":"Richard W Howard","fullNameInverted":"Howard, Richard W","middleInitial":"W","primaryEmail":"richard.w.howard@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62108,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Westhelle","fullName":"Carlos H Westhelle","fullNameInverted":"Westhelle, Carlos H","middleInitial":"H","primaryEmail":"carlos.h.westhelle@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

To meet this need, this project will explore the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) based, and, VR + artificial intelligence (AI) based training systems in the context of crew robotics operations. This project will develop and deliver a breadboard VR/AI virtual classroom and perform a comparative demonstration to the traditional ISS Generic Robotics Training course with operations test subjects.

From a strength and properties standpoint, modern materials are capable of withstanding these conditions. However without test data, hardware owners are not willing to accept the unknown flammability risk. A flammability test system has been designed and is currently being built at WSTF to test at unprecedented pressures, up to 30,000 psi. Before this capability was developed, the agency (and the world), was unable to determine the pressure where many key pressure system materials sustain combustion. Knowing where metals such as copper and nickel sustain combustion can help to design modern oxygen Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) and propulsion systems that achieve higher pressures and performance with reduced risk of fire.

We will also perform tests to maximize the design effectiveness of ISRU and other hardware to be used at the lunar poles.","description":"Volatile-rich samples from the lunar poles are high-priority targets for both human explorers and scientists. Volatiles are located in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) at the lunar poles, which remain at 30-70 K for the entirety of a lunar year. Precious lunar PSR samples could be irreparably altered if stored at high (70+K) temperatures, resulting in inaccurate assessments of the volatile abundance on the Moon.  We propose to use capabilities developed in IRAD Year 1 to accomplish three goals.  Goal 1: assess lunar volatile alteration under flight-like conditions continue development of a high-fidelity volatile-rich lunar simulant.  Goal 2: increase sample storage capacity for curation and engineering tests.  Goal 3: Conduct necessary ISRU tests for lunar operations. We will complete baseline storage evaluations using the lunar simulant developed at JSC. We will also incorporate an enhanced sample storage system to the lunar testbed constructed in IRAD Year 1, and conduct critical ISRU tests with JSC engineers working on those systems.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1544,"code":"THE_MOON","description":"The Moon","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2019,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2020,"endMonth":9,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":254913,"firstName":"Julie","lastName":"Mitchell","fullName":"Julie L Mitchell","fullNameInverted":"Mitchell, Julie L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"julie.l.mitchell@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":335305,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lapointe","fullName":"Michael R Lapointe","fullNameInverted":"Lapointe, Michael R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"michael.r.lapointe@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":392233,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Howard","fullName":"Richard W Howard","fullNameInverted":"Howard, Richard W","middleInitial":"W","primaryEmail":"richard.w.howard@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62108,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Westhelle","fullName":"Carlos H Westhelle","fullNameInverted":"Westhelle, Carlos H","middleInitial":"H","primaryEmail":"carlos.h.westhelle@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

Small wireless sensors, based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, can provide unprecedented capacity to monitor crew/habitat health. We are developing a next-generation, wireless air quality sensor capable of operating for years on a small coin-cell battery without crewmember intervention. Integrating a state-of-the-art commercial CO2 sensor, this platform can acquire and wirelessly transport samples with a projected battery lifetime of to 27.5 years on a CR2450 coin cell (10 mins./sample). Having proven the feasibility of store-and-forward data transport using RFID links in year 1, we have focused this year on integrating the algorithm into the RFID-enhanced Autonomous Logistics Management (REALM) to study both its impact on REALM inventory management and REALM’s impact on RFID data transfer. These experiments have guided a re-implementation that will position REALM for RFID sensing support on Station/Gateway. We have also designed and implemented an interface to the most advanced COTS CO2 sensor available as an alternative to the ARC CO2 nano-materials sensor, whose continues at ARC. With improvements in reducing quiescent current consumption, at duty cycles comparable to PCO2M, this exceeds the high end of the promised range with a lifetime in excess of 13 years CR2032 coin cell, and with a slightly larger CR2450, it will achieve close in excess of 27.5 years.

Even though the char yield and thermal expansion characteristics were good, exposure to simulated reentry environments in a plasma torch resulted in swelling and the formation of an unstable char. Therefore, thermoplastics were not investigated further. The focus changed to thermoset resin mixtures and how to print them. A custom auger-based extruder was designed and built and installed on a commercial printer. With the assistance of Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL), the candidate thermoset resin mixtures were reformulated for printability and then successfully printed at JSC and at ORNL. Test articles for plasma torch testing were printed by both JSC and ORNL and then tested. All of the thermoset resin mixture-based test articles tested performed well forming a stable char in the high-temperature flow field. Test articles for thermal conductivity and tensile testing are now being printed. The capability to deposit the material on a small sphere-cone shape representative of a heat shield for a small capsule was also demonstrated.","infoText":"Closed out","infoTextExtra":"","dateText":"September 2019"}],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

This project supports 3 of JSC's 6 technology development priority areas: the need to minimize human forward contamination will inform life support system and EVA suit designs; human forward contamination could also affect where we locate - or how crews operate - potential in situ resource utilization equipment to minimize source contamination. Unlike the rovers that we cleaned once and sent on their way, humans will be a perpetual source of microbial contaminants. Understanding what--if any--microbes are escaping from our suits or life support systems will help us develop hardware that meets planetary protection protocols and mitigates contamination of Mars surface science. If we wait until Mars surface system hardware is designed and built, it will be costly to retrofit or redesign planetary protection provisions. The ISS is an ideal test bed to evaluate the kinds of microbes escaping from our spacecraft and suits, but we currently have no capability for surface sampling outside the spacecraft.</p> ","description":"<p>In the project period we will perform ground tests to sample and characterize microbial contamination on external spacesuit surfaces under destination conditions. Sample collection in a space environment is complicated by low pressure that requires dry (rather than wetted) collection swabs and a special container design to mitigate contamination as the sample is transported between a spacecraft pressure cabin and external vacuum environment. Collecting microbial samples outside of a spacecraft also requires tools that meet EVA requirements, to prevent damage to spacesuit gloves or sensitive spacecraft hardware, and prevent the tool from becoming loose. The U.S. currently has no capability to collect EVA microbial samples. The Russians have an EVA swab tool designed to sample for corrosion, but the tool's sterility and appropriateness for bacterial sampling has been questioned (findings that suggested plankton outside of ISS were withdrawn from prior to publishing). The current prototype device is adequate for form, fit, and function testing, but cannot be used to sample flight hardware (Class I spacesuits or life support systems) unless additional certification and testing is completed to upgrade for Class I use. FY17 IRAD funding would allow us to upgrade the prototype EVA sampling kit, which will allow us to take the kit into a vacuum chamber to continue ground testing, and eventually to ISS to begin sampling external life support system vents and spacesuits.</p>","startYear":2016,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2017,"endMonth":7,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":342870,"firstName":"Michelle","lastName":"Rucker","fullName":"Michelle I Rucker","fullNameInverted":"Rucker, Michelle I","middleInitial":"I","primaryEmail":"michelle.i.rucker@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":335305,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lapointe","fullName":"Michael R Lapointe","fullNameInverted":"Lapointe, Michael R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"michael.r.lapointe@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":392233,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Howard","fullName":"Richard W Howard","fullNameInverted":"Howard, Richard W","middleInitial":"W","primaryEmail":"richard.w.howard@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62108,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Westhelle","fullName":"Carlos H Westhelle","fullNameInverted":"Westhelle, Carlos H","middleInitial":"H","primaryEmail":"carlos.h.westhelle@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

Ultrasound requires significant operator skill to acquire quality images, and those images need expert interpretation to make clinical decisions. Kidney stones are considered a great risk for spaceflight (and are very common on Earth), and ultrasound is an excellent way to diagnose them. We aim to apply DML techniques to aid in the diagnosis of kidney stones by ultrasound. It is unlikely that untrained ultrasound operators could perform kidney ultrasounds of sufficient quality to make a diagnosis. We are therefore supporting the development of Augmented Realty (AR)-assisted ultrasound scanning to make the data collection process consistently effective. We are collecting a large kidney ultrasound dataset to be fed into our DML system to identify the presence or absence of stones. The required renal ultrasound imagery is collected following a set scanning protocol that is being used in our AR scanning process with the aim to create an end-to-end system, from scanning the patient to establishing a diagnosis. This system, once complete, will be of great use in deep Space exploration as well as in terrestrial medical settings, especially in resource-limited or remote areas. Even experts can struggle in making accurate ultrasound diagnoses. Radiologists recognize that variations in image interpretation can lead to misdiagnosis. Medical images contain huge amounts of information, subtle features, variation of characteristics and for this reason, there is a need to engage technologies of advanced computer-aided image analysis, plus standardized protocols. Deep Machine Learning (DML) technology is developing, and we expect that such will be used to aid in interpreting medical imagery. Risk for renal stone formation is 1 of 30 risks for Deep Space Journey, Habitation & Planetary. Technology Gaps being addressed include: HRR-GAP-Med10: Lack of computed medical decision support capability during exploration missions and HRR-GAP-Med 05: Lack of knowledge in crew training for medical decision making and medical skills to enable extended missions and autonomous operations. This gap identifies the need for autonomous medical decision support to augment knowledge of decision-making crewmembers. Our aim is to use closed-loop ultrasound guidance and AI/DML for medical image interpretation. Learning how to perform scans autonomously is of great medical benefit to NASA for deep-space missions with delayed communication, and supports crew autonomy, preventive care and crew health for cis-lunar gateway/lunar outpost and extended exploration missions.</p>","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1543,"code":"EARTH","description":"Earth","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1544,"code":"THE_MOON","description":"The Moon","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1518,"code":"MARS","description":"Mars","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2019,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2020,"endMonth":9,"statusDescription":"Completed","programDirectors":[{"contactId":335305,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lapointe","fullName":"Michael R Lapointe","fullNameInverted":"Lapointe, Michael R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"michael.r.lapointe@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":392233,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Howard","fullName":"Richard W Howard","fullNameInverted":"Howard, Richard W","middleInitial":"W","primaryEmail":"richard.w.howard@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62108,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Westhelle","fullName":"Carlos H Westhelle","fullNameInverted":"Westhelle, Carlos H","middleInitial":"H","primaryEmail":"carlos.h.westhelle@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[{"transitionId":19126,"projectId":117409,"transitionDate":"2020-09-01","path":"Closed Out","details":"Kidney stones are considered a great risk for human spaceflight and ultrasound is an excellent way to diagnose them.

time for science and operating payloads. This project supports this goal by providing context relevant information and a natural language based user interface to support the crew's daily tasks and activities. By providing a deep ISS relevant procedure domain knowledge, the \"Siri-like\" SCA can increase the crew autonomy and reduce human error. The SCA can access and leverage the information collected over the past, (for instance a previous occurrence of a procedure execution) and help the crew perform the same procedure in a more efficient way in the future. The \"Siri-like\" SCA technology can be applied to multiple industries, provided that the domain knowledge captured is well adapted to the targeted users. As our focus is the Human Spaceflight domain, and specifically the on board procedure domain, this project can directly benefit other commercial space participants. Some of the same concepts captured for NASA's benefit will be able to be applied to other members of the commercial space industry. The concept can also be applied to other government agencies such as the DoD, to develop specialized assistants to the soldier of the future. The smart assistant would enable the users to obtain the critical information needed at the right time cutting through the clutter of possible similar but not interesting pieces of data.</p>","description":"<p>The objective of this project is to capture in a report an assessment of the possibility to adapt Siri-like technology to crew support, and to develop a limited prototype of the concept.#NASA's mission operations concept has evolved over the past half century but it relies on extensive ground support for both nominal and off-nominal operations. Next-gen missions will require decreased Earth-based support due to the increased communication time lag. NASA's vision of manned spaceflight into deep space cannot be realized by projecting the current mission ops concept forward. A \"Siri-like\" crew assistant will provide support when/where/as needed, understand the Crew communication protocols, have access and knowledge about the crew timeline and procedures, enable the crew to get just-in-time training refreshers, be capable of communicating with spacecraft systems, get the telemetry of interest to understand the current status and upcoming tasks that the astronaut is involved in, and be the communication hub between the astronaut and the ground during specific missions phases. This \"Siri-like\" Smart Crew Assistant (\"Siri-like\" SCA) serves as a \"just-in-time\" performance support tool that could not only improve mission timelines but also increase crew autonomy from the earth ground support.</p>","startYear":2013,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2014,"endMonth":11,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":299301,"firstName":"Lui","lastName":"Wang","fullName":"Lui Wang","fullNameInverted":"Wang, Lui","primaryEmail":"lui.wang-1@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":335305,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lapointe","fullName":"Michael R Lapointe","fullNameInverted":"Lapointe, Michael R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"michael.r.lapointe@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":392233,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Howard","fullName":"Richard W Howard","fullNameInverted":"Howard, Richard W","middleInitial":"W","primaryEmail":"richard.w.howard@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62108,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Westhelle","fullName":"Carlos H Westhelle","fullNameInverted":"Westhelle, Carlos H","middleInitial":"H","primaryEmail":"carlos.h.westhelle@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[{"transitionId":19131,"projectId":117424,"transitionDate":"2014-11-01","path":"Closed Out","infoText":"Closed out","infoTextExtra":"","dateText":"November 2014"}],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

This project will develop novel blood staining and imaging technology. This clinical test, the 'manual differential' portion of a complete blood count (CBC) is the most commonly ordered clinical laboratory test here on Earth. Using the developed kit a crewmember would be able to perform a 'Wright' stain on a fingerstick blood smear in minutes. The images could be interpreted by a trained/medical crewmember, or downlinked to Flight Surgeon for immediate evaluation. Automated analysis of the blood cell counts is a distinct possibility for follow-on development. The primary technical innovation will be a robust hand held 200x microscope (sensor, optics, casing) suitable for critical diagnostic and lunar ops/research purposes. The miniaturized microscope can be coupled with the staining kit, or deployed individually to support a broad range of operational and research activities on the lunar surface. For example, the device could be used to immediately analyze any vehicle contaminants on surfaces, in water or in food.

A central aspect of this is the ability to navigate independent of the ground.  ","description":"Future crewed and uncrewed exploration vehicles will be operating in environments far removed from the Earth and will be required to operate and navigate with minimal support from the ground. The use of millisecond x-ray pulsars as a source of timing and navigation is being demonstrated in LEO with SExTANT/NICER. The capability of these systems needs to be matured in preparation for the Evolvable Mars Campaign (EMC) missions. At the very least, an x-ray navigation sensor can be used to complement optical navigation as an accurate timing source for Mars and Earth entry. This sensor has the added benefit of aiding the astrophysics (x-ray astronomy) community in getting science outside of LEO.

One of the major challenges in developing a system which will operate far from planetary bodies is to maintain an accurate navigation state which will allow the vehicle to reach its goal (or equivalently to return the crew to Earth) in the case of loss of communications with the ground. To that end, x-ray navigation is a perfect complement to optical navigation which will allow the vehicle to navigate autonomously to achieve the mission objectives. The challenges addressed in this project was to mature both the hardware and the understanding of how a crewed vehicle can use x-ray navigation outside of Low Earth Orbit (LEO). In the past two years Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) trajectories were used to evaluate the performance of a single x-ray sensor. The results showed that the attitude requirements of using a single x-ray sensor are rather tight; having more than one x-ray sensor working together, either pointed in the same direction or in a different direction will allow for more opportunities to obtain measurements without placing undue burden on the attitude control system. We initiated conversations with Gateway to use it as a platform to mature the hardware and to determine the performance of such a sensor system in cis-lunar space away from Earth.","infoText":"Closed out","infoTextExtra":"","dateText":"September 2019"}],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

Infrared-blocking filters are needed to minimize the heat load on receiver cryogenic systems, stabilizing the instrument and extending mission lifetime. Future instruments require that they do so over increasingly larger apertures, while maintaining high in-band transmission. Aerogel scattering filters have ultra-low density and index of refraction (n<1.07), removing the need for anti-reflection coatings that limit bandwidth and increase filter complexity. By choosing the size distribution of the silicon particles embedded as scatterers in the filter, the cutoff frequency of the filter is tunable with strong rejection across all frequencies above the cutoff. Aerogel scattering filters would enable a broad range of missions, including the Probe of Inflation and Cosmic Origins (PICO) and future SOFIA instruments.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1547,"code":"OUTSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Outside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2019,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2022,"endMonth":9,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":505283,"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Essinger-Hileman","fullName":"Thomas M Essinger-hileman","fullNameInverted":"Essinger-Hileman, Thomas M","middleInitial":"M","primaryEmail":"thomas.m.essinger-hileman@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":332808,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Garcia","fullName":"Michael A Garcia","fullNameInverted":"Garcia, Michael A","middleInitial":"A","publicEmail":false,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":123302,"firstName":"Dominic","lastName":"Benford","fullName":"Dominic J Benford","fullNameInverted":"Benford, Dominic J","middleInitial":"J","primaryEmail":"dominic.j.benford@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"coInvestigators":[{"contactId":108695,"firstName":"David","lastName":"Leisawitz","fullName":"David T Leisawitz","fullNameInverted":"Leisawitz, David T","middleInitial":"T","primaryEmail":"david.t.leisawitz@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":471653,"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Marriage","fullName":"Tobias Marriage","fullNameInverted":"Marriage, Tobias","primaryEmail":"marriage@pha.jhu.edu","publicEmail":false,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":68124,"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Bennett","fullName":"Charles L Bennett","fullNameInverted":"Bennett, Charles L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"cbennett@jhu.edu","publicEmail":false,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":506293,"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Wollack","fullName":"Edward J Wollack","fullNameInverted":"Wollack, Edward J","middleInitial":"J","primaryEmail":"edward.j.wollack@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":173950,"firstName":"Haiquan","lastName":"Guo","fullName":"Haiquan Guo","fullNameInverted":"Guo, Haiquan","primaryEmail":"haiquan.n.guo@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":15453,"firstName":"Alyssa","lastName":"Barlis","fullName":"Alyssa C Barlis","fullNameInverted":"Barlis, Alyssa C","middleInitial":"C","primaryEmail":"alyssa.barlis@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":318406,"firstName":"Mary","lastName":"Meador","fullName":"Mary A Meador","fullNameInverted":"Meador, Mary A","middleInitial":"A","primaryEmail":"maryann.meador@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":505830,"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Quijada","fullName":"Manuel A Quijada","fullNameInverted":"Quijada, Manuel A","middleInitial":"A","primaryEmail":"manuel.a.quijada@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"SMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4909,"organizationName":"Science Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"APRA","active":true,"description":"<p>The Astrophysics Research Program competitively solicits low TRL (1-3) technology development activities of a more general nature through the Astrophysics Research and Analysis (APRA) Program element of ROSES.

It is emitted from a variety of anthropogenic (human-influenced) and natural sources, among them biomass burning, fossil fuel combustion, and biogenic sources (including wetlands and rice paddies).&nbsp;Methane is hard to track because it comes from many sources and is chemically oxidized in the troposphere by the hydroxyl radical. It also becomes well-mixed in the atmosphere by meteorological systems and diffusive process as it is transported across continents and oceans. Complicating matters even further is the 9-year methane atmospheric lifetime that allows it to accumulate in the atmosphere. Increasing methane not only affects tropospheric ozone pollution levels, but methane also absorbs in the infrared, making it 86 times more potent at trapping heat as CO<sub>2</sub> over a 20-year period.</p><p>Recent studies (Saunois et al., 2016) suggest that concentrations of methane in the atmosphere are now rising at their fastest pace in two decades, thus raising the urgency of developing and flying space-based methane measuring instruments.</p><p>The development of the proposed compact, <strong>D</strong>igital <strong>A</strong>rray <strong>G</strong>as filter <strong>R</strong>adiometer instrument (<strong>DAGR</strong>) will serve as the first step in establishing NASA as the leader in constellation-based, temporally nimble, space-based methane measurements. DAGR possesses a footprint and power requirement that readily enables its flight with the already in development NASA active LHR methane/methane isotope instrument on the same smallsat bus. DAGR is the first to exploit a new method of sensing greenhouse gas using passive sensor images of solar backscatter radiation.

This novel method, mitigating the ambient column difficulties of sensing surface gas concentrations, will be definitively validated by the proposed effort.

The project has developed the Modular Electronic Standard for Space Power Systems, which defines the form, fit, and function of each modular power unit for human exploration missions and systems. </p>  <p>Additionally, the AMPS technology portfolio includes the development of an autonomous power controller (APC) to manage electrical space power systems without a human operator in the loop. The APC provides 3 main functions:</p>  <ul><li>Energy management: Manage the on-board electrical power system to ensure safe and stable operations, all power system constraints are not violated, and power qualifications are met.</li><li>Fault management: Detect and identify the size, location, and type of fault, and quickly isolate hazardous failures in the system. This enables the autonomous controller to take the proper corrective and facilitate system recovery.</li><li>Contingency management: Manage the electrical power system configuration and create plans for distributing power during fault scenarios and ability to return the electrical power system back to nominal configuration/operation.</li></ul>  <p>The AMPS APC team is collaborating with external partners in developing the APC capability for a lunar surface based electrical power utility. A collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories is focused on managing power of the lunar electrical power utility, which is made up of smaller islanded microgrids that contain their own power generation and energy storage. This hierarchical power controller enables the sharing of power between the islanded microgrids to ensure all higher level lunar surface objectives are met even during failure scenarios. The APC team is also working with the US Army on expandable and reconfigurable electrical microgrids that can seamlessly integrate dissimilar power sources to maximize electrical power availability. In this effort, the APC team will integrate the US Army developed Tactical Microgrid Standard (TMS) into an AMPS modular hardware based power system and evaluate the ability for TMS to support evolvable and reconfigurable electrical power systems. If this effort is successful, NASA will be able to leverage additional capabilities developed under the TMS effort and take advantage of DoD supply chain in developing power system components for the lunar surface.</p> ","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1544,"code":"THE_MOON","description":"The Moon","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1518,"code":"MARS","description":"Mars","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1546,"code":"INSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Others Inside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"supportedMission":{"lkuCodeId":1541,"code":"PROJECTED_MISSION","description":"Projected Mission (Pull)","lkuCodeTypeId":527,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"SUPPORTED_MISSION_TYPE","description":"Supported Mission Type"}},"startYear":2011,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2023,"endMonth":10,"statusDescription":"Active","programDirectors":[{"contactId":80868,"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Moore","fullName":"Christopher L Moore","fullNameInverted":"Moore, Christopher L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"christopher.moore@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":482936,"firstName":"Victoria","lastName":"Andrews","fullName":"Victoria P Andrews","fullNameInverted":"Andrews, Victoria P","middleInitial":"P","primaryEmail":"victoria.p.andrews@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":393166,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Mcginnis","fullName":"Richard S Mcginnis","fullNameInverted":"Mcginnis, Richard S","middleInitial":"S","primaryEmail":"richard.mcginnis@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":350056,"firstName":"Nantel","lastName":"Suzuki","fullName":"Nantel Suzuki","fullNameInverted":"Suzuki, Nantel","primaryEmail":"nantel.h.suzuki@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":223542,"firstName":"Jitendra","lastName":"Joshi","fullName":"Jitendra A Joshi","fullNameInverted":"Joshi, Jitendra A","middleInitial":"A","primaryEmail":"jitendra.a.joshi@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":128304,"firstName":"Douglas","lastName":"Craig","fullName":"Douglas A Craig","fullNameInverted":"Craig, Douglas A","middleInitial":"A","primaryEmail":"douglas.a.craig-1@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":38558,"firstName":"Barry","lastName":"Epstein","fullName":"Barry G Epstein","fullNameInverted":"Epstein, Barry G","middleInitial":"G","primaryEmail":"barry.epstein@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"projectManagers":[{"contactId":260330,"displayOrder":1,"firstName":"Karin","lastName":"Bozak","fullName":"Karin E Bozak","fullNameInverted":"Bozak, Karin E","middleInitial":"E","primaryEmail":"karin.bozak@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":211845,"displayOrder":2,"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Csank","fullName":"Jeffrey T Csank","fullNameInverted":"Csank, Jeffrey T","middleInitial":"T","primaryEmail":"jeffrey.t.csank@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"website":"","libraryItems":[{"file":{"fileExtension":"pdf","fileId":101007,"fileName":"AMPS Project 101 -

Following the Academy recommendation to consider using a multi-function lidar to address two or more of the Observables, our 60-beam, configurable instrument would be well suited to acquire the measurements for the three near-term surface observables as well as aerosol and cloud profiling. Our hyperspectral imaging directly applies to the Surface Biology and Geology observable and the lidar/hyperspectral integration will, in fact, advance capabilities for all five of the Earth surface observables by providing compositional and functional information directly associated with the elevation data. This is especially the case for Terrestrial Ecosystem Structure objectives of ecosystem dynamics, rates of primary production, evapotranspiration, carbon uptake and changing land use which need both structure and function information. Funding is needed at this time to demonstrate the capabilities over the next three years, with the intent to acquire additional funding to raise TRLs to 5-6 in preparation for mission proposal opportunities starting in 2021-22. The longer-term goal of global lidar mapping can be accomplished using multiple 60-beam modules, sharing the same seed laser and grating, and imaging the footprints onto groups of pixels in larger linear-mode HgCdTe arrays. Because of lowered cost and SWaP, instrument copies could be distributed in a constellation of SmallSats to accelerate mapping, point at rapidly changing natural hazards and acquire diurnal sampling needed to fully characterize ecosystem processes.</p> ","description":"<p>We propose to integrate next-generation lidar, compact hyperspectral imaging and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to provide a new remote sensing measurement capability for a broad range of Earth and planetary science objectives. A groundbreaking lidar module consisting of a high-pulse-rate, fast-wavelength-tuning fiber laser and time-division-multiplexing receiver will make height measurements using 60 steerable beams with drastically increased efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art. Concurrent hyperspectral imaging will greatly enhance science capabilities and real-time, AI neural network analysis of the images will enable optimized data collection and on-board processing. Incorporating these multiple emerging technologies will substantially reduce instrument size, weight and power thereby enabling lower-cost SmallSat-class missions with enhanced scientific return

Current low Earth orbiting (LEO) weather satellites are limited in number and are thus unable to provide data with the necessary temporal resolution. A constellation of cloud profiling instruments in LEO would provide this essential capability, however, new instrument architectures, compatible with low-cost satellite platforms, such as CubeSats and SmallSats are needed to enable such missions. W-band radars operating at 94 GHz are particularly attractive for studying clouds because of greater sensitivity of millimeter-waves to cloud particles and the significant reduction in instrument size at W-band. We propose to develop the first RF-photonics radar receiver subsystem to enable the next generation of ultra-compact millimeter wave radars suitable for cloud and precipitation profiling, planetary boundary layer observation, altimetry and surface scattering measurements. The improved RF-photonics architecture was first proposed for a different application, here we propose to adapt the concept specifically for a W-band (94GHz) radar, which is generally assessed to be the primary means for observing clouds in the free troposphere as well as planetary boundary layer from space. The radically different receiver architecture offers the following advantages with respect to a typical W-band RF receiver: 1) reduced number of components and interfaces and therefore reduced size, weight and power (SWaP) requirements, 2) lower system noise (and therefore improved sensitivity), 3) integrated generation of high quality 94 GHz reference frequency (and therefore reduced ground clutter contamination over the desired cloud echoes when paired with a highly linear and low phase noise amplifier). Any one of these advantages is highly desirable form a systems point of view, however a device with all these characteristics will be a true game changer for earth observing W-band radars on resource constrained platforms. During this project we will advance the state-of-the-art of Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM) resonators for W-band applications using numerical simulations and lab experiments. We will also design, build and test a high-performance W-band LO. We will fabricate and package the photonics receiver and LO, and characterize its performance (system temperature, input power tolerance, gain, linearity, dynamic range etc.) over various temperature conditions and integrate in a W-band radar test-bed and compare with traditional receiver architectures to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the novel RF-photonics approach.</p> ","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1543,"code":"EARTH","description":"Earth","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2021,"startMonth":4,"endYear":2024,"endMonth":3,"statusDescription":"Active","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":386309,"displayOrder":1,"firstName":"Razi","lastName":"Ahmed","fullName":"Razi U Ahmed","fullNameInverted":"Ahmed, Razi U","middleInitial":"U","primaryEmail":"razi.u.ahmed@jpl.nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":363458,"firstName":"Pamela","lastName":"Millar","fullName":"Pamela S Millar","fullNameInverted":"Millar, Pamela S","middleInitial":"S","primaryEmail":"pamela.s.millar@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":16561,"firstName":"Amber","lastName":"Emory","fullName":"Amber E Emory","fullNameInverted":"Emory, Amber E","middleInitial":"E","primaryEmail":"amber.emory@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"coInvestigators":[{"contactId":259861,"displayOrder":1,"firstName":"Karen","lastName":"Piggee","fullName":"Karen R Piggee","fullNameInverted":"Piggee, Karen R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"karen.r.piggee@jpl.nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":438692,"displayOrder":2,"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Tanelli","fullName":"Simone Tanelli","fullNameInverted":"Tanelli, Simone","primaryEmail":"simone.tanelli@jpl.nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":123032,"displayOrder":3,"firstName":"Dmitry","lastName":"Strekalov","fullName":"Dmitry V Strekalov","fullNameInverted":"Strekalov, Dmitry V","middleInitial":"V","primaryEmail":"dmitry.v.strekalov@jpl.nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":357869,"displayOrder":4,"firstName":"Ninoslav","lastName":"Majurec","fullName":"Ninoslav Majurec","fullNameInverted":"Majurec, Ninoslav","primaryEmail":"ninoslav.majurec@jpl.nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":23618,"displayOrder":5,"firstName":"Andrey","lastName":"Matsko","fullName":"Andrey B Matsko","fullNameInverted":"Matsko, Andrey B","middleInitial":"B","primaryEmail":"andrey.b.matsko@jpl.nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"website":"","libraryItems":[],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"SMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4909,"organizationName":"Science Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"ACT","active":true,"description":"<p><strong>Objectives</strong><br />The ACT funds the research, development, and demonstration of component- and subsystem-level technologies to reduce the risk, cost, size, mass, and development time of missions and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>The ACT brings instrument, platform, and information system components to a maturity level that allows their integration into other NASA-funded technology projects, such as those funded by the Instrument Incubator Program.
