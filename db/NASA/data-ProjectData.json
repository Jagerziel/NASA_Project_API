Generally, Earth's oceans are similar to these extraterrestrial ocean worlds, but the closest analogs are deep-sea hydrothermal vents where microbes cycle nutrients and energy across a range of geochemical conditions. All of these ecosystems share one central physical parameter - high hydrostatic pressure - and piezophily is the common characteristic of life in the deep ocean. This high-pressure adaptation confers a competitive advantage to piezophiles, allowing them to access additional energy sources and expand habitable niches. While deep-sea microbes have been studied extensively, obligate piezophiles remain elusive, excluded by traditional decompressive sampling techniques. Putative microbial communities in the deep oceans of Europa, Enceladus, and Titan would necessarily be piezophiles, therefore instrument development for upcoming missions to ocean worlds must include the ability to (1) detect life under high pressure conditions and/or (2) develop sample handling and life detection analysis protocols that mitigate the effects of sample decompression on analytical outcomes. The DEEP project will take advantage of a new high pressure sampling system (PUSH50) that allows for sample retrieval and manipulation without decompression. Here we propose a field research program to the Earth's deepest hydrothermal vents, the Mid Cayman Rise, in order to develop high pressure sample handling protocols that optimize life detection in high pressure environments. METHODOLOGY: We will evaluate the fidelity of a range of life detection techniques on a variety of deep-sea vent samples for which in situ pressures have been maintained throughout the analytical process, and compare these to parallel samples that have been subjected to standard decompressive techniques. We aim to: (1) identify the most robust suite of analyses for life detection in high pressure ecosystems; (2) determine the instrumental/analytical requirements for in situ life detection on future ocean worlds missions. In situ detection of microbial communities will include: quantification of cell and biomass; characterization of species and metabolic diversity; enrichment cultivation for high value target metabolisms;  and measurement of geochemical isotopic biosignatures. Many of these techniques can be (and are currently being) adapted for remote deployment on landers and rovers. Our proposed research will identify which of these techniques is most robust in high-pressure environments, optimize in situ analysis protocols for high-pressure ecosystems, and develop the technology necessary to implement these protocols in upcoming mission instrument packages SIGNIFICANCE This work addresses the following PSTAR Objectives. Science: We will elucidate the processes by which high pressure microbiomes are sensitive to traditional decompression sampling, characterize the metabolic and species diversity that has been obscured by these techniques, and develop new approaches to detecting these enigmatic piezophiles in high pressure environments. Technology: We will perform the first tests of a newly developed sampling system that maintains high in situ pressures during recovery. We will further develop the technology and protocols necessary for carrying out life detection under high pressures.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1546,"code":"INSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Others Inside the Solar

Competitive calls are coordinated with JSC Senior Staff and communicated to the JSC workforce via internal email distribution to an R&amp;D community list and through postings on the internal center website and through JSC Today notices.<br /><br />The JTWG solicits, evaluates and prioritizes all JSC solicitation responses in a two-stage process. The JTWG members review project proposals and work together to down-select to the finalists. The Principal Investigators (PIs) make presentations to the JTWG to provide more in-depth project details. This allows the members to have multiple sets of data to select the most innovative finalists to support for the year.&nbsp; Selection criteria and funding vary based on the focus of the solicitation; but of primary interest are:</p><ul><li>Human Space Flight Architecture Team (HAT) prioritized technology needs</li><li>Priority JSC technology core competencies</li><li>High potential areas for technology commercialization</li><li>High potential areas for technology partnerships</li></ul><p><em>Project Accomplishments</em></p><p>Through the result of research and development, JSC&rsquo;s IR&amp;D project PIs are making essential progress in the advancement of technology needed to enable NASA&rsquo;s mission of space exploration. Additionally, many of the technologies developed to meet the challenges of space exploration have great commercialization potential. Each year, many of JSC&rsquo;s IR&amp;D projects file New Technology Reports (NTRs) through the JSC Tech Transfer Office. Several of these reports have received New Technology Evaluation Patent ratings to pursue patents, while additional ones have been scheduled for success story articles to be written and published.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JSC projects active in FY12 and beyond have been included in TechPort. Through the TechPort tool information on the projects is provided and will be updated by PIs as developments and updates become available. This will offer further knowledge and information sharing between NASA developers, researchers, engineers and scientists, and other internal and external stakeholders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","parentProgram":{"acronym":"IRAD","active":true,"programId":87,"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"MSD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4910,"organizationName":"Mission Support Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"responsibleMdId":4910,"title":"Center Independent Research & Development"},"parentProgramId":87,"programId":155,"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"MSD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4910,"organizationName":"Mission Support Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"responsibleMdId":4910,"title":"Center Independent Research & Development: JSC IRAD"},"leadOrganization":{"acronym":"JSC","canUserEdit":false,"city":"Houston","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4853,"organizationName":"Johnson Space Center","organizationType":"NASA_Center","stateTerritory":{"abbreviation":"TX","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"name":"Texas","stateTerritoryId":29},"stateTerritoryId":29,"naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Center"},"supportingOrganizations":[{"acronym":"ARC","canUserEdit":false,"city":"Moffett Field","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4941,"organizationName":"Ames Research Center","organizationType":"NASA_Center","stateTerritory":{"abbreviation":"CA","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"name":"California","stateTerritoryId":59},"stateTerritoryId":59,"naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Center"}],"statesWithWork":[{"abbreviation":"CA","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"name":"California","stateTerritoryId":59},{"abbreviation":"TX","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"name":"Texas","stateTerritoryId":29}],"lastUpdated":"2022-12-16","releaseStatusString":"Released","endDateString":"Sep 2022","startDateString":"Jun 2022"},{"acronym":"RISC Reduction","projectId":94824,"title":"Reducing the Cost of Flight Data Systems with the RISC-V Computer Architecture","primaryTaxonomyNodes":[{"taxonomyNodeId":10570,"taxonomyRootId":8816,"parentNodeId":10567,"level":3,"code":"TX02.1.3","title":"High Performance Processors","definition":"High Performance Processors provide advanced data processing functions at high speeds delivering powerful and reliable computing resources capable of executing computationally expensive algorithms in a short period.

The APRA-funded development of the NGMSA focused exclusively on eliminating the magnetic actuation and was successful on 128 x 64 pixel format pilot arrays. However, it utilized the JWST-era MEMS manufacturing process for which our ability to achieve recurrent manufacturability is low. We have severe process yield problems to resolve.&nbsp; We have designed a MEMS architecture change that is simpler to fabricate than the JWST-era process that we are currently struggling with and intended to use for the proposed SAT program.

The ability to monitor cardiovascular health (i.e., blood vessel function) and markers of oxidative stress in situ would be a significant advance in astronaut health care. The capability to measure markers of oxidative stress and endothelial function in a short-step, minimal sample handling method could enable crews to monitor health maintenance throughout a space exploration mission. Ultimately, this will provide new technology for analyzing blood samples that will be easier, faster, cheaper, and less wasteful.

These methods could eventually be adapted for inflight use and could provide in situ analysis of astronaut health on Artemis and/or exploration-class missions. The concept of measuring blood NO and ONOO- levels in humans using a reaction-based SERS method and commercial, handheld Raman spectrometer will be evaluated in a pilot study with volunteer test subjects.

This project supports 3 of JSC's 6 technology development priority areas: the need to minimize human forward contamination will inform life support system and EVA suit designs; human forward contamination could also affect where we locate - or how crews operate - potential in situ resource utilization equipment to minimize source contamination. Unlike the rovers that we cleaned once and sent on their way, humans will be a perpetual source of microbial contaminants. Understanding what--if any--microbes are escaping from our suits or life support systems will help us develop hardware that meets planetary protection protocols and mitigates contamination of Mars surface science. If we wait until Mars surface system hardware is designed and built, it will be costly to retrofit or redesign planetary protection provisions. The ISS is an ideal test bed to evaluate the kinds of microbes escaping from our spacecraft and suits, but we currently have no capability for surface sampling outside the spacecraft.</p> ","description":"<p>In the project period we will perform ground tests to sample and characterize microbial contamination on external spacesuit surfaces under destination conditions. Sample collection in a space environment is complicated by low pressure that requires dry (rather than wetted) collection swabs and a special container design to mitigate contamination as the sample is transported between a spacecraft pressure cabin and external vacuum environment. Collecting microbial samples outside of a spacecraft also requires tools that meet EVA requirements, to prevent damage to spacesuit gloves or sensitive spacecraft hardware, and prevent the tool from becoming loose. The U.S. currently has no capability to collect EVA microbial samples. The Russians have an EVA swab tool designed to sample for corrosion, but the tool's sterility and appropriateness for bacterial sampling has been questioned (findings that suggested plankton outside of ISS were withdrawn from prior to publishing). The current prototype device is adequate for form, fit, and function testing, but cannot be used to sample flight hardware (Class I spacesuits or life support systems) unless additional certification and testing is completed to upgrade for Class I use. FY17 IRAD funding would allow us to upgrade the prototype EVA sampling kit, which will allow us to take the kit into a vacuum chamber to continue ground testing, and eventually to ISS to begin sampling external life support system vents and spacesuits.</p>","startYear":2016,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2017,"endMonth":7,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":342870,"firstName":"Michelle","lastName":"Rucker","fullName":"Michelle I Rucker","fullNameInverted":"Rucker, Michelle I","middleInitial":"I","primaryEmail":"michelle.i.rucker@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":335305,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lapointe","fullName":"Michael R Lapointe","fullNameInverted":"Lapointe, Michael R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"michael.r.lapointe@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":392233,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Howard","fullName":"Richard W Howard","fullNameInverted":"Howard, Richard W","middleInitial":"W","primaryEmail":"richard.w.howard@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62108,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Westhelle","fullName":"Carlos H Westhelle","fullNameInverted":"Westhelle, Carlos H","middleInitial":"H","primaryEmail":"carlos.h.westhelle@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

Even though the char yield and thermal expansion characteristics were good, exposure to simulated reentry environments in a plasma torch resulted in swelling and the formation of an unstable char. Therefore, thermoplastics were not investigated further. The focus changed to thermoset resin mixtures and how to print them. A custom auger-based extruder was designed and built and installed on a commercial printer. With the assistance of Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL), the candidate thermoset resin mixtures were reformulated for printability and then successfully printed at JSC and at ORNL. Test articles for plasma torch testing were printed by both JSC and ORNL and then tested. All of the thermoset resin mixture-based test articles tested performed well forming a stable char in the high-temperature flow field. Test articles for thermal conductivity and tensile testing are now being printed. The capability to deposit the material on a small sphere-cone shape representative of a heat shield for a small capsule was also demonstrated.","infoText":"Closed out","infoTextExtra":"","dateText":"September 2019"}],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

navigate autonomously without relying on the DSN and the ground to determine its navigation state. x-ray navigation, along with optical navigation will provide a navigation capability that will be essential for the Evolvable Mars Campaign. This technology addresses two key requirements: accurate navigation and autonomy.All future architectures for crewed exploration of the Solar System will require the vehicles such as Gateway to operate autonomously for periods of time without relying on the DSN and the ground to determine its navigation state.  In particular, the delays due to one-way light time may be up to several minutes.  These vehicles will be required to return the crew to Earth in case of loss of communications with the ground.  A central aspect of this is the ability to navigate independent of the ground.  ","description":"Future crewed and uncrewed exploration vehicles will be operating in environments far removed from the Earth and will be required to operate and navigate with minimal support from the ground. The use of millisecond x-ray pulsars as a source of timing and navigation is being demonstrated in LEO with SExTANT/NICER. The capability of these systems needs to be matured in preparation for the Evolvable Mars Campaign (EMC) missions. At the very least, an x-ray navigation sensor can be used to complement optical navigation as an accurate timing source for Mars and Earth entry. This sensor has the added benefit of aiding the astrophysics (x-ray astronomy) community in getting science outside of LEO.

One of the major challenges in developing a system which will operate far from planetary bodies is to maintain an accurate navigation state which will allow the vehicle to reach its goal (or equivalently to return the crew to Earth) in the case of loss of communications with the ground. To that end, x-ray navigation is a perfect complement to optical navigation which will allow the vehicle to navigate autonomously to achieve the mission objectives. The challenges addressed in this project was to mature both the hardware and the understanding of how a crewed vehicle can use x-ray navigation outside of Low Earth Orbit (LEO). In the past two years Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) trajectories were used to evaluate the performance of a single x-ray sensor. The results showed that the attitude requirements of using a single x-ray sensor are rather tight; having more than one x-ray sensor working together, either pointed in the same direction or in a different direction will allow for more opportunities to obtain measurements without placing undue burden on the attitude control system. We initiated conversations with Gateway to use it as a platform to mature the hardware and to determine the performance of such a sensor system in cis-lunar space away from Earth.","infoText":"Closed out","infoTextExtra":"","dateText":"September 2019"}],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

This analog consists of a VR system with altered visual feedback that mimics vestibular disorientation coupled with galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) to effectively render the vestibular system useless. Method 1 involves partnering with the Astronaut Strength, Conditioning and Rehabilitation specialists (ASCRs) to implement this training with their assigned crewmembers. We will utilize existing medical and science data through data sharing agreements to determine the efficacy of this countermeasure. Method 2 involves determining the mechanism of training (sensorimotor adaptation or strategic learning) and developing a model that can predict an individual's adaptation/learning rate. Through these two parallel methods, we can validate this tool as a sensorimotor countermeasure, determine its efficacy on returning crewmembers, and develop a predictive model to determine adaptation rate.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1544,"code":"THE_MOON","description":"The Moon","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2019,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2020,"endMonth":9,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":344514,"firstName":"Millard","lastName":"Reschke","fullName":"Millard F Reschke","fullNameInverted":"Reschke, Millard F","middleInitial":"F","primaryEmail":"millard.f.reschke@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":335305,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lapointe","fullName":"Michael R Lapointe","fullNameInverted":"Lapointe, Michael R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"michael.r.lapointe@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":392233,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Howard","fullName":"Richard W Howard","fullNameInverted":"Howard, Richard W","middleInitial":"W","primaryEmail":"richard.w.howard@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62108,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Westhelle","fullName":"Carlos H Westhelle","fullNameInverted":"Westhelle, Carlos H","middleInitial":"H","primaryEmail":"carlos.h.westhelle@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

State-of-the-Art: Dual loop TCS with oversized radiators and an external flow loop with a toxic low freezing point fluid that connects to a non-toxic inner cabin loop via an interface heat exchanger. This TCS architecture is employed in Orion and can achieve a 3:1 turndown ratio. Design concepts for cis-lunar habitats have employed a dual-loop architecture with a regenerative heat exchanger to achieve a 8:1 turndown ratio. ","description":"Innovative aspect: The morphing radiator uses SMAs to passively change its heat rejection area (opening/closing its cylindrical panel). The concept can provide high turndown: >12:1 with a single loop active TCS. During FY16 a composite radiator panel was developed, and demonstrated actuating with SMAs in ambient and thermal vacuum environments.FY17 objective: Develop an entire practical radiator design and produce a subscale segment of a multi-panel radiator with the following approach: 1) Create custom SMAs to open/close the radiator at the hot/cold cases expected by a single loop active TCS for a manned spacecraft (cis-lunar/mars missions). 2) Integrate the SMAs into the radiator panel design. 3) Develop a processing method to bond SMAs to the radiator face sheet. 4) Develop a robust method to bond the radiator panel to its flow tube. 5) Build upon existing analytical tools to expedite radiator design. Next steps after FY17 work: 1)System-level ground test on the produced radiator. 2)Investigate methods to provide a low absorptivity/high emissivity coating of the radiator panel. 3)ISS express pallet flight demonstration. Comparison to other variable heat rejection approaches: As opposed to stagnating, freezable, and digital radiators, this concept does not require emptying/refilling of passages (which risks freezing upon refilling), or modification of the radiator fluid's state (recovering from freezing/stagnating can be very slow and difficult to predict). JAxA/ISAS developed and thermal vacuum tested a passive SMA actuated flat radiator panel for a 100W class satellite [Nagano and Nagasaka 2006].","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1543,"code":"EARTH","description":"Earth","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1544,"code":"THE_MOON","description":"The Moon","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1518,"code":"MARS","description":"Mars","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2016,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2017,"endMonth":7,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":294703,"firstName":"Lisa","lastName":"Erickson","fullName":"Lisa Erickson","fullNameInverted":"Erickson, Lisa","primaryEmail":"lisa.erickson@ngc.com","publicEmail":false,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":335305,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lapointe","fullName":"Michael R Lapointe","fullNameInverted":"Lapointe, Michael R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"michael.r.lapointe@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":392233,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Howard","fullName":"Richard W Howard","fullNameInverted":"Howard, Richard W","middleInitial":"W","primaryEmail":"richard.w.howard@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62108,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Westhelle","fullName":"Carlos H Westhelle","fullNameInverted":"Westhelle, Carlos H","middleInitial":"H","primaryEmail":"carlos.h.westhelle@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

It is therefore critical that TOCA technology be miniaturized, hardened, and flight-tested in preparation for Exploration. This project is the first step in that sequence. Utilizing a subsystems approach, this project builds on both ISS TOCA development experience and the results from the first year of funding under the Center Independent Research and Development Program. MiniTOCA subsystems are physically stacked and combined to minimize or eliminate plumbing. Breadboarding is accomplished iteratively, with software (state machine) being written and refined in parallel with subsystem hardware changes. The power draw of the MiniTOCA will be within reach of either laptop USB port or rechargeable batteries. The MiniTOCA will be self-contained and hand-held. Eventually, a MiniTOCA flight system could serve as a back-up to the current TOCA units on ISS.#We anticipate that the water loop will be closed to a great extent on nearly all Exploration missions, meaning that all wastewater will be recycled - urine, condensate, hygiene wastewater, etc. The first significant human mission outside of Low Earth Orbit will need the miniTOCA. After a 3rd year of development funding, we envision the technology could be made ready for demonstration on ISS within 2 years. Success of an ISS flight experiment (technology demonstration) would ensure readiness of the MiniTOCA technology for future Exploration vehicles and habitats.</p>","description":"<p>The objective of this development is to create a prototype hand-held, 1 to 2 liter size battery-powered Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOCA).#The majority of missions beyond LEO require that all waste water sources on spacecraft be recycled into drinking water and verified clean to protect crew health. Total Organic Carbon (TOC) is the sum of the carbon content of all organic contaminants in the water, and measuring TOC is a key method to monitor over all water quality, and is useful for tracking water processor system performance. If the TOC in the recycled water is kept low (< 1 part per million-ppm), the need to measure specific organic compounds is diminished if not eliminated entirely. This project will develop a greatly simplified and miniaturized TOCA vs. the current state of the art (locker sized, 40 kg). The current state of the art TOCA is fine for International Space Station, but Exploration missions cannot accomodate the mass, volume and power required. The goal of the project therefore is to reduce the mass, volume and power by more than 90%.#By miniaturizing the system, the required volume of water for analysis also diminishes.

Ultrasound requires significant operator skill to acquire quality images, and those images need expert interpretation to make clinical decisions. Kidney stones are considered a great risk for spaceflight (and are very common on Earth), and ultrasound is an excellent way to diagnose them. We aim to apply DML techniques to aid in the diagnosis of kidney stones by ultrasound. It is unlikely that untrained ultrasound operators could perform kidney ultrasounds of sufficient quality to make a diagnosis. We are therefore supporting the development of Augmented Realty (AR)-assisted ultrasound scanning to make the data collection process consistently effective. We are collecting a large kidney ultrasound dataset to be fed into our DML system to identify the presence or absence of stones. The required renal ultrasound imagery is collected following a set scanning protocol that is being used in our AR scanning process with the aim to create an end-to-end system, from scanning the patient to establishing a diagnosis. This system, once complete, will be of great use in deep Space exploration as well as in terrestrial medical settings, especially in resource-limited or remote areas. Even experts can struggle in making accurate ultrasound diagnoses. Radiologists recognize that variations in image interpretation can lead to misdiagnosis. Medical images contain huge amounts of information, subtle features, variation of characteristics and for this reason, there is a need to engage technologies of advanced computer-aided image analysis, plus standardized protocols. Deep Machine Learning (DML) technology is developing, and we expect that such will be used to aid in interpreting medical imagery. Risk for renal stone formation is 1 of 30 risks for Deep Space Journey, Habitation & Planetary. Technology Gaps being addressed include: HRR-GAP-Med10: Lack of computed medical decision support capability during exploration missions and HRR-GAP-Med 05: Lack of knowledge in crew training for medical decision making and medical skills to enable extended missions and autonomous operations. This gap identifies the need for autonomous medical decision support to augment knowledge of decision-making crewmembers. Our aim is to use closed-loop ultrasound guidance and AI/DML for medical image interpretation. Learning how to perform scans autonomously is of great medical benefit to NASA for deep-space missions with delayed communication, and supports crew autonomy, preventive care and crew health for cis-lunar gateway/lunar outpost and extended exploration missions.</p>","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1543,"code":"EARTH","description":"Earth","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1544,"code":"THE_MOON","description":"The Moon","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1518,"code":"MARS","description":"Mars","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2019,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2020,"endMonth":9,"statusDescription":"Completed","programDirectors":[{"contactId":335305,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lapointe","fullName":"Michael R Lapointe","fullNameInverted":"Lapointe, Michael R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"michael.r.lapointe@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":392233,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Howard","fullName":"Richard W Howard","fullNameInverted":"Howard, Richard W","middleInitial":"W","primaryEmail":"richard.w.howard@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62108,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Westhelle","fullName":"Carlos H Westhelle","fullNameInverted":"Westhelle, Carlos H","middleInitial":"H","primaryEmail":"carlos.h.westhelle@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[{"transitionId":19126,"projectId":117409,"transitionDate":"2020-09-01","path":"Closed Out","details":"Kidney stones are considered a great risk for human spaceflight and ultrasound is an excellent way to diagnose them.

This project will develop novel blood staining and imaging technology. This clinical test, the 'manual differential' portion of a complete blood count (CBC) is the most commonly ordered clinical laboratory test here on Earth. Using the developed kit a crewmember would be able to perform a 'Wright' stain on a fingerstick blood smear in minutes. The images could be interpreted by a trained/medical crewmember, or downlinked to Flight Surgeon for immediate evaluation. Automated analysis of the blood cell counts is a distinct possibility for follow-on development. The primary technical innovation will be a robust hand held 200x microscope (sensor, optics, casing) suitable for critical diagnostic and lunar ops/research purposes. The miniaturized microscope can be coupled with the staining kit, or deployed individually to support a broad range of operational and research activities on the lunar surface. For example, the device could be used to immediately analyze any vehicle contaminants on surfaces, in water or in food.

This has the potential to recover 575 pounds of water per year from brine. This represents roughly $10M per year in savings on water resupply costs. While the primary function of the CoBRA is to recover water from concentrated wastewater brines generated by a primary processor, the CoBRA may be able to function as a primary processor itself. Current state-of-the-art primary processors rely on rotating drums, pitot pumps, lobe compressors, and other sensitive machinery for operation. This equipment has a history of becoming fouled due to solids precipitation. In the case of a failure of the primary processor, the CoBRA could serve as a backup, providing dissimilar redundancy to ensure crew survival. Upon successful demonstration of a proof-of-concept evaporator, Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) will provide funding for further development. This will lead to infusion of CoBRA technology into an integrated closed-loop life support system architecture. The CoBRA will then be poised to play a key role in a future ground-based integrated life support systems test, and an eventual ISS detailed test objective (DTO). After a successful DTO, CoBRA could be integrated into the International Space Station (ISS) life support system, with the potential to recover 575 pounds of water per year from brine. This represents roughly $10M per year in savings on water resupply costs. Leveraging the extensive technology maturation and testing accomplished through a DTO, the CoBRA will then be ready for use by future deep-space exploration programs. Coiled Brine Recovery Assembly (CoBRA) technology also has the potential to be used for water recovery from contaminated wastes in the chemical, nuclear, and hydraulic fracturing industries.</p>","description":"<p>The Coiled Brine Recovery Assembly (CoBRA) project will result in a proof-of-concept demonstration for a lightweight, compact, affordable, regenerable and disposable solution to brine water recovery.

While it will be necessary to build or modify a system for testing the CoBRA concept, the emphasis of this project will be on developing the evaporator itself. This project will utilize a \"test early, test often\" approach, building at least one trial evaporator to guide the design of the final product.</p>","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1545,"code":"THE_SUN","description":"The Sun","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2014,"startMonth":11,"endYear":2015,"endMonth":10,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":450794,"firstName":"Stuart","lastName":"Pensinger","fullName":"Stuart J Pensinger","fullNameInverted":"Pensinger, Stuart J","middleInitial":"J","primaryEmail":"stuart.j.pensinger@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":335305,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lapointe","fullName":"Michael R Lapointe","fullNameInverted":"Lapointe, Michael R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"michael.r.lapointe@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":392233,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Howard","fullName":"Richard W Howard","fullNameInverted":"Howard, Richard W","middleInitial":"W","primaryEmail":"richard.w.howard@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62108,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Westhelle","fullName":"Carlos H Westhelle","fullNameInverted":"Westhelle, Carlos H","middleInitial":"H","primaryEmail":"carlos.h.westhelle@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

Currently, OASSIS is developing a small lab-scale platform with guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) sensors and software with the goal of researching and maturing precision landing functions. The platform, named Navigation, Estimation, and Sensing Testbed (NEST), enables lunar lander flight software to be tested dynamically without the need of a costly flight campaign and without the risk of catastrophic hardware loss.

Bluetooth Personal CO2 Monitors (PCO2Ms) flying on ISS provide an initial capability, but need for frequent recharge (~4 days) allows limited scaling and no long-duration autonomy. We finalize the design of an ultra-low power wireless sensing platform (JSC) and integrate it with an ultra-low power CO2 sensor (ARC) to give a flight-certifiable, wearable or peel/stick platform that can operate for years at a time without battery recharge/replacement. The sensor will be forward-compatible with existing ISS RFID inventory management infrastructure for follow-on flight demos, and costs will be augmented by AES funding to integrate SBIR-produced location tracking sensors. This will provide a capability un-matched by any SoA wireless sensor package and can easily extend to other sensing modalities (ammonia, radiation, etc.), addressing the JSC technology priority area of Automation and ECLSS.

Having proven the feasibility of store-and-forward data transport using RFID links in year 1, we have focused this year on integrating the algorithm into the RFID-enhanced Autonomous Logistics Management (REALM) to study both its impact on REALM inventory management and REALM’s impact on RFID data transfer. These experiments have guided a re-implementation that will position REALM for RFID sensing support on Station/Gateway. We have also designed and implemented an interface to the most advanced COTS CO2 sensor available as an alternative to the ARC CO2 nano-materials sensor, whose continues at ARC. With improvements in reducing quiescent current consumption, at duty cycles comparable to PCO2M, this exceeds the high end of the promised range with a lifetime in excess of 13 years CR2032 coin cell, and with a slightly larger CR2450, it will achieve close in excess of 27.5 years. As a next step, we plan to infuse position sensing into the platform and transition this to a flight implementation under AES Logistics Management to demonstrate on ISS with REALM-1.","infoText":"Closed out","infoTextExtra":"","dateText":"September 2019"}],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

We will also perform tests to maximize the design effectiveness of ISRU and other hardware to be used at the lunar poles.","description":"Volatile-rich samples from the lunar poles are high-priority targets for both human explorers and scientists. Volatiles are located in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) at the lunar poles, which remain at 30-70 K for the entirety of a lunar year. Precious lunar PSR samples could be irreparably altered if stored at high (70+K) temperatures, resulting in inaccurate assessments of the volatile abundance on the Moon.  We propose to use capabilities developed in IRAD Year 1 to accomplish three goals.  Goal 1: assess lunar volatile alteration under flight-like conditions continue development of a high-fidelity volatile-rich lunar simulant.  Goal 2: increase sample storage capacity for curation and engineering tests.  Goal 3: Conduct necessary ISRU tests for lunar operations. We will complete baseline storage evaluations using the lunar simulant developed at JSC. We will also incorporate an enhanced sample storage system to the lunar testbed constructed in IRAD Year 1, and conduct critical ISRU tests with JSC engineers working on those systems.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1544,"code":"THE_MOON","description":"The Moon","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2019,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2020,"endMonth":9,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":254913,"firstName":"Julie","lastName":"Mitchell","fullName":"Julie L Mitchell","fullNameInverted":"Mitchell, Julie L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"julie.l.mitchell@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":335305,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lapointe","fullName":"Michael R Lapointe","fullNameInverted":"Lapointe, Michael R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"michael.r.lapointe@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":392233,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Howard","fullName":"Richard W Howard","fullNameInverted":"Howard, Richard W","middleInitial":"W","primaryEmail":"richard.w.howard@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62108,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Westhelle","fullName":"Carlos H Westhelle","fullNameInverted":"Westhelle, Carlos H","middleInitial":"H","primaryEmail":"carlos.h.westhelle@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

","description":"OASSIS year 3 innovates with three goals: 1) transition to a generic configuration compatible with GNC flight software, 2) implement a new, computationally-efficient TRN algorithm for lunar landing, and 3) integrate with the HWIL testbed to validate lunar landing GNC systems. This project enables lunar lander GNC flight software to be tested dynamically without the need of a costly flight campaign and without the risk of catastrophic hardware loss.  Additionally, the TRN algorithm development and testing enhances the state-of-the-art in pinpoint landing navigation, ultimately improving the overall landing accuracy, safety, and reliability of a crewed lunar landing mission.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1544,"code":"THE_MOON","description":"The Moon","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2019,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2020,"endMonth":9,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":197514,"firstName":"James","lastName":"Mccabe","fullName":"James S Mccabe","fullNameInverted":"Mccabe, James S","middleInitial":"S","primaryEmail":"james.s.mccabe@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":335305,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lapointe","fullName":"Michael R Lapointe","fullNameInverted":"Lapointe, Michael R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"michael.r.lapointe@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":392233,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Howard","fullName":"Richard W Howard","fullNameInverted":"Howard, Richard W","middleInitial":"W","primaryEmail":"richard.w.howard@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62108,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Westhelle","fullName":"Carlos H Westhelle","fullNameInverted":"Westhelle, Carlos H","middleInitial":"H","primaryEmail":"carlos.h.westhelle@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"JSC CIF","active":true,"description":"<p>JSC provides and applies its preeminent capabilities in science and technology to develop, operate, and integrate human exploration missions. &nbsp;The Center encourages collaboration with aerospace and non-aerospace industries, government agencies, and academia to solve science and technology challenges, while actively striving to maximize technology transfer into the commercial sector. &nbsp;</p><p>An active and sustainable science and technology development program is key to ensuring the challenges of human exploration are successfully overcome.

Aerogel scattering filters have ultra-low density and index of refraction (n<1.07), removing the need for anti-reflection coatings that limit bandwidth and increase filter complexity. By choosing the size distribution of the silicon particles embedded as scatterers in the filter, the cutoff frequency of the filter is tunable with strong rejection across all frequencies above the cutoff. Aerogel scattering filters would enable a broad range of missions, including the Probe of Inflation and Cosmic Origins (PICO) and future SOFIA instruments.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1547,"code":"OUTSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Outside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2019,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2022,"endMonth":9,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":505283,"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Essinger-Hileman","fullName":"Thomas M Essinger-hileman","fullNameInverted":"Essinger-Hileman, Thomas M","middleInitial":"M","primaryEmail":"thomas.m.essinger-hileman@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":332808,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Garcia","fullName":"Michael A Garcia","fullNameInverted":"Garcia, Michael A","middleInitial":"A","publicEmail":false,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":123302,"firstName":"Dominic","lastName":"Benford","fullName":"Dominic J Benford","fullNameInverted":"Benford, Dominic J","middleInitial":"J","primaryEmail":"dominic.j.benford@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"coInvestigators":[{"contactId":108695,"firstName":"David","lastName":"Leisawitz","fullName":"David T Leisawitz","fullNameInverted":"Leisawitz, David T","middleInitial":"T","primaryEmail":"david.t.leisawitz@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":471653,"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Marriage","fullName":"Tobias Marriage","fullNameInverted":"Marriage, Tobias","primaryEmail":"marriage@pha.jhu.edu","publicEmail":false,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":68124,"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Bennett","fullName":"Charles L Bennett","fullNameInverted":"Bennett, Charles L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"cbennett@jhu.edu","publicEmail":false,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":506293,"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Wollack","fullName":"Edward J Wollack","fullNameInverted":"Wollack, Edward J","middleInitial":"J","primaryEmail":"edward.j.wollack@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":173950,"firstName":"Haiquan","lastName":"Guo","fullName":"Haiquan Guo","fullNameInverted":"Guo, Haiquan","primaryEmail":"haiquan.n.guo@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":15453,"firstName":"Alyssa","lastName":"Barlis","fullName":"Alyssa C Barlis","fullNameInverted":"Barlis, Alyssa C","middleInitial":"C","primaryEmail":"alyssa.barlis@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":318406,"firstName":"Mary","lastName":"Meador","fullName":"Mary A Meador","fullNameInverted":"Meador, Mary A","middleInitial":"A","primaryEmail":"maryann.meador@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":505830,"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Quijada","fullName":"Manuel A Quijada","fullNameInverted":"Quijada, Manuel A","middleInitial":"A","primaryEmail":"manuel.a.quijada@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"SMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4909,"organizationName":"Science Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"APRA","active":true,"description":"<p>The Astrophysics Research Program competitively solicits low TRL (1-3) technology development activities of a more general nature through the Astrophysics Research and Analysis (APRA) Program element of ROSES.

Such measurements are inaccessible by any current remote sensing method, and directly address the PBL targeted observable outlined in the 2017 Decadal Survey, which called for technology incubation to enable profiling of PBL water vapor and temperature from space with 200 m vertical resolution. Global-scale, high-resolution measurements of PBL thermodynamics are essential in order to improve the representation of unresolved PBL processes in climate and weather models, with impacts to several high-value science questions including low-cloud climate feedbacks and severe weather predictability. The TWT amplifier is a key component in the envisioned architecture for a spaceborne DAR that is capable of sensitively detecting clouds in a variety of cloudy PBL scenes while satisfying the 200 m vertical resolution requirement for humidity profiles. Therefore, we propose to advance the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from 2 to 4 of a TWT-based high-power amplifier module that meets the requirements for spaceborne DAR operation. This work builds on technology heritage at Northrop Grumman Mission Systems in compact, high-power vacuum source development at millimeter and submillimeter-wave frequencies, and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in DAR instrument development and measurement validation through the Vapor In-cloud Profiling Radar (VIPR, IIP-16 and AITT-19) project.</p>  <p> </p>  <p>The TWT-based high-power amplifier proposed here represents a state-of-the-art, compact solution to the problem of efficient high-power generation at unconventionally high radar frequencies. The TWT design will be based on a proven narrowband component at 233 GHz developed for a DARPA-initiated airborne radar program, but under this effort significant innovations will be incorporated into the source design to make it specifically relevant to deployment in an orbital DAR system. Relative to previous G-band high-power amplifier modules, this subsystem will feature a 10x reduction in both volume and mass, achieved by using a periodic permanent magnet instead of a solenoid to confine the vacuum source electron beam; the TWT circuit design will have higher gain to ensure 100 W operation despite lower available input power levels from solid-state 167-174.8 GHz drive sources; and the cathode high-voltage supply will be able to switch at the microsecond time scale between two states in order to tune the TWT center frequency between the online (174.8 GHz) and offline (167 GHz) DAR frequencies at a rate much faster than the radar pulse repetition frequency. During the first two years of this three-year effort, multiple TWT amplifier prototypes will be designed, fabricated, and evaluated to ensure that the final integrated module meets the performance requirements of 100 W output power, 25% duty cycle, 5% tuning bandwidth, and 10 kHz frequency-switching speed. In the final year, the VIPR system will serve as a testbed for verifying the TWT performance in realistic atmospheric measurement scenarios and for demonstrating its in-cloud profiling capability.</p> ","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1543,"code":"EARTH","description":"Earth","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2021,"startMonth":4,"endYear":2024,"endMonth":4,"statusDescription":"Active","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":491821,"displayOrder":1,"firstName":"William","lastName":"Deal","fullName":"William R Deal","fullNameInverted":"Deal, William R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"william.deal@ngc.com","publicEmail":false,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":363458,"firstName":"Pamela","lastName":"Millar","fullName":"Pamela S Millar","fullNameInverted":"Millar, Pamela S","middleInitial":"S","primaryEmail":"pamela.s.millar@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":16561,"firstName":"Amber","lastName":"Emory","fullName":"Amber E Emory","fullNameInverted":"Emory, Amber E","middleInitial":"E","primaryEmail":"amber.emory@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"coInvestigators":[{"contactId":491821,"displayOrder":1,"firstName":"William","lastName":"Deal","fullName":"William R Deal","fullNameInverted":"Deal, William R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"william.deal@ngc.com","publicEmail":false,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":394123,"displayOrder":2,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Roy","fullName":"Richard J Roy","fullNameInverted":"Roy, Richard J","middleInitial":"J","primaryEmail":"richard.j.roy@jpl.nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":505849,"displayOrder":3,"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Kreischer","fullName":"Kenneth E Kreischer","fullNameInverted":"Kreischer, Kenneth E","middleInitial":"E","primaryEmail":"kenneth.kreischer@ngc.com","publicEmail":false,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":505850,"displayOrder":4,"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Basten","fullName":"Mark A Basten","fullNameInverted":"Basten, Mark A","middleInitial":"A","primaryEmail":"mark.basten@ngc.com","publicEmail":false,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":322371,"displayOrder":5,"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Lebsock","fullName":"Matthew D Lebsock","fullNameInverted":"Lebsock, Matthew D","middleInitial":"D","primaryEmail":"matthew.d.lebsock@jpl.nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false},{"contactId":506332,"displayOrder":6,"firstName":"John","lastName":"Tucek","fullName":"John C Tucek","fullNameInverted":"Tucek, John C","middleInitial":"C","primaryEmail":"jack.tucek@ngc.com","publicEmail":false,"nacontact":false}],"website":"","libraryItems":[],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"SMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4909,"organizationName":"Science Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"ACT","active":true,"description":"<p><strong>Objectives</strong><br />The ACT funds the research, development, and demonstration of component- and subsystem-level technologies to reduce the risk, cost, size, mass, and development time of missions and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>The ACT brings instrument, platform, and information system components to a maturity level that allows their integration into other NASA-funded technology projects, such as those funded by the Instrument Incubator Program.

processes, water stability, etc. These exchanges occur through turbulent eddies, requiring fast sampling, and high sensitivity and precision to resolve, a capability out of reach of all previous martian wind sensors. Our Mars Sonic Anemometer is ~20X faster, more sensitive and precise than predecessors and enables direct measurement of the turbulent eddies, and thus their surface-atmosphere exchanges. Measurements with our Mars Sonic Anemometer would advance our understanding of aeolian processes, saltation, dust lifting, the energy balance of the diurnal convective layer, the stability of water in the subsurface, etc. These advancements are all relevant to Decadal Survey & NASA Strategic Goals such as “Understand the processes and history of climate.” Our instrument would also likely contribute to atmospheric model improvement through providing a richer constraining data set, likely reducing future risks in EDL to, and Ascent from, Mars.</p>  <p> </p>  <p>It would be applicable on essentially all but the absolute smallest of Mars landers, requiring only ~500g and 500mW. With minor adaptations, it could also be used on a Venus cloud-level balloon mission, in Earth’s stratosphere (potentially commercially), on Titan, or on Saturn or Ice Giant Probes.</p>  <p>With support from PICASSO, the Mars Sonic Anemometer is currently at TRL5, having demonstrated prototypes that meet our science requirements under Mars conditions in the Danish Mars Wind Tunnel. We will harden our ultrasonic transducers against shock and vibe, and thermal extremes and cycling. We will also optimize the design of the sensor head (“spider”) to minimize wind shadowing, optimize the electronics to reduce mass and power while using rad-hard parts, and migrate the software to flight requirements. Finally, we will validate the instrument to TRL6 with performance tests in a representative martian environment, thermal extreme and thermal cycling tests, and shock and vibe tests. These will place the Mars Sonic Anemometer in position to be included on any upcoming Mars surface mission, or with small adaptations, mission opportunities at Venus, Earth, Saturn, Uranus or Neptune
